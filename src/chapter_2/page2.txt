 ey didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met
for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a
sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were
as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.  e Dursleys shuddered

street.  e Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but
they had never even seen him.  is boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with
a child like that.
